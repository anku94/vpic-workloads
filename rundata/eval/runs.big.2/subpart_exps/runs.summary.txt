only 250k runs

1-3: with 4x subpartitioning
4-6: with 1x subpartitioning
7-9: with only one bucket (no repart)
10-12: only one bucket + sort disabled

13-15: like (0-2) but with 400s sleep interval
13-15 v1 runtime:
1699
1762
1839

13-15 overwritten. big overnight break so SSDs should be compacted by now. 

run.13 v2: 1699 -> 1771

run.13 v3: 1771 -> 1508 (different, fresher cluster)

run.14 v2: (subpart disabled; sort disabled)

also 1507 (!? - did it slow down a bit?)

run.15 v2: (subpart/sort enabled; 2000s sleep, same cluster as run.13v3 and run.14v2)

1497s


theory: time increases because of SSDs starting to compact in the background
